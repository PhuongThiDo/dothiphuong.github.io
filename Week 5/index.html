        <p1 class="p">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements on a web page. It allows developers to separate content from design, making websites more flexible and easier to maintain. With CSS, you can define styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and responsiveness across multiple pages. CSS supports various rule types including selectors, properties, and values, and can be applied inline, internally within HTML, or externally via linked files. As a core technology of the web, CSS plays a vital role in creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.
